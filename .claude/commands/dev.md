# Dev Server

Start the development server and verify it's working.

Steps:
1. Kill any existing node processes on port 3000
2. Start the server with `node index.js` in the background
3. Wait for it to be ready, then verify with a curl to `http://localhost:3000/tasks`
4. Report the server status and number of existing tasks
5. If a browser tab is available, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and take a screenshot

If the server fails to start, read the error output and diagnose the issue.
