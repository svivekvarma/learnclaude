# Update Documentation

Sync the README.md with the current state of the project.

Steps:
1. Read all source files to understand current features, endpoints, and schema.
2. Read the current README.md.
3. Update the README to accurately reflect:
   - All features currently implemented
   - All API endpoints with correct parameters
   - The current task object schema (all fields)
   - Query parameters for filtering
   - Accurate test count
   - Current tech stack and dependencies
   - Up-to-date curl examples
4. Do NOT add features that don't exist. Only document what's actually in the code.
5. Keep the same style and structure as the existing README.
6. Show a diff summary of what changed.
